Unlike the specific FSU types included, which represent types of known FSUs, the OtherFSU Type is used to represent a discrete model of any other type of FSU you might need.
OtherFSU Types are instantiated as FSUs installed within Devices, or as available spares in a Location.
For example, you may define an OtherFSU Type for a **Flux Capacitor**, part number **88-6-1950**.
Multiple instances of the OtherFSU Type, named `fc_0`, `fc_1`, etc., can then be created as FSUs installed in a particular Device.
