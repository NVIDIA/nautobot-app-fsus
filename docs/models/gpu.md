A GPU represents a physical GPU asset, which is either in use and assigned to a device, or an available spare and assigned to a storage location.
Each GPU must be based on a [GPU Type](gputype.md), must have a name, and must be assigned to either a device or storage location.
Other information that can be tracked includes its serial number, asset tag, and description.
State data can also be set for the firmware version, the device driver name, the driver version, the PCI slot ID it occupies (if installed in a device), and a parent [GPU Baseboard](gpubaseboard.md).
