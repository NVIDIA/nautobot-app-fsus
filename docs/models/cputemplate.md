A template for a CPU instance that will be created on all instantiations of the parent device type.
Each CPU template instance is assigned a physical [CPU Type](cputype.md), a name, and a description (optional).
The name field supports alphanumeric ranges for bulk creation, for example, setting the name to `cpu_[0-3]` will create 4 CPU template instances with the digits in the name incremented from 0 to 3.
