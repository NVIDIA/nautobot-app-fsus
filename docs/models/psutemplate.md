A template for a power supply unit (PSU) instance that will be created on all instantiations of the parent device type.
Each PSU template instance is assigned a physical [PSU Type](psutype.md), a name, a redundancy state, and a description (optional).
The name field supports alphanumeric ranges for bulk creation, for example, setting the name to `PSU-[0-1]` will create two PSU template instances named `PSU-00` and `PSU-01`.
