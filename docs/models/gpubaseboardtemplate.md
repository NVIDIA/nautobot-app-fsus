A template for a GPU Baseboard instance that will be created on all instantiations of the parent device type.
Each GPU Baseboard template instance is assigned a physical [GPU Baseboard Type](gpubaseboardtype.md), a name, and a description (optional).
The name field supports alphanumeric ranges for bulk creation, for example, setting the name to `bb_[0-4]` will create 5 Baseboard template instances with the digits in the name incremented from 0 to 4.
