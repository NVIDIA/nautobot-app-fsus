# Overview

!!! note
    This document (and all of Nautobot, really) uses the terms "app" and "plugin" interchangeably.

The FSUs app adds Field Serviceable Units to Nautobot.
Field Serviceable Units in the app are items that are not full devices themselves, but benefit from being tracked as separate assets, such as GPUs, CPUs, etc.
FSUs can be assigned either a parent Device, or a Location, allowing for spare inventory tracking.
